    Introduction
    ------------

    AIDE is a tool for monitoring file system changes. It can be used
    to detect unauthorized monitored files and directories. AIDE was
    written to be a simple and free alternative to Tripwire. Features
    currently included in AIDE are as follows:

        o  File attributes monitored: permissions, inode, user, group
           file size, mtime, atime, ctime, links and growing size.
        o  Checksums and hashes supported: SHA1, MD5, RMD160, and TIGER.
           CRC32, HAVAL and GOST if Mhash support is compiled in.
        o  Plain text configuration files and database for simplicity.
        o  Rules, variables and macros that can be customized to local
           site or system policies.
        o  Powerful regular expression support to selectively include or
           exclude files and directories to be monitored.
        o  gzip database compression if zlib support is compiled in.
        o  Stand alone static binary for easy client/server monitoring
           configurations.
        o  Free software licensed under the GNU General Public License.

    Current Version
    ---------------

    AIDE is currently maintained on GitHub.

    Please visit https://github.com/aide/aide/ to get the newest version of
    the source code.

    Documentation
    -------------

    The documentation for AIDE can be found in the doc/ directory.

    Installation
    ------------
    For generic instructions please see the INSTALL file.

    For AIX 5.3 it has been reported there is a problem with using mhash
    which causes an "Undefined symbol: .rpl_malloc" error. This is a problem
    in mhash_config.h which can be fixed by removing the line that reads
    #define malloc rpl_malloc

    For Mac OS X Darwin/Leopard (10.4/10.5) and Solaris 10/OpenSolaris you need
    to use --disable-static when configuring AIDE. Please note that dynamic
    linking introduces a security risk and is not recommended.

    Since Mac OS Leopard (10.5) you also need to use --disable-lfs because it
    handles 64 bit file support out of the box.

    Source Code Verification
    ------------------------

    We highly recommend checking that the version of AIDE downloaded and
    installed is an original and unmodified one. You can either verify the
    source tarball or the git tag.

    To check the supplied signature with GnuPG:

      $ gpg --verify aide-<VERSION_NUMBER>.tar.gz.asc

    This checks that the detached signature file is indeed a signature
    of aide-<VERSION_NUMBER>.tar.gz.

    To validate the gpg signature of the git tag:

      $ git verify-tag v<VERSION_NUMBER>

    The current public key needed for signature verification is:

        pub   4096R/68E7B931 2011-06-28 [expires: 2021-06-27]
        uid                  Hannes von Haugwitz <hannes@vonhaugwitz.com>

    If you do not have this key, you can get it from one of the well known PGP
    key servers. You have to make sure that the key you install is not a faked
    one. You can do this with reasonable assurance by comparing the output of:

      $ gpg --fingerprint 0x68E7B931

    with the fingerprint published elsewhere.

    Requirements
    ------------

    AIDE requires the following development tools:

       o  C compiler (such as Gcc).
       o  GNU flex.
       o  GNU yacc (bison).
       o  GNU make.
       o  PCRE library
       o  Mhash (optional, but highly recommended). Mhash is currently
          available from http://mhash.sourceforge.net/. A static version of
          libmhash needs to be build using the --enable-static=yes
          configure option.
          Aide requires at least mhash version 0.9.2

    Note:
      flex version 2.5.31 is broken, you might see the following error

       conf_lex.c: In function `conflex':
       conf_lex.c:4728: error: `yy_prev_more_offset' undeclared (first use in
       this function)
       conf_lex.c:4728: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
       conf_lex.c:4728: error: for each function it appears in.)

      Either downgrade to flex 2.5.4 or get an updated version that fixes
      this bug.

    Large File Support
    -----------------

    To be able to store the size of files larger than 2GB, aide needs
    large file support (LFS) to be available in the OS. The configure
    script automatically checks for the correct defines and functions.
    If configure fails, and during compile time you see errors containing
    the number 64, try configure again with the --disable-lfs option.
    This turns off the large file support.

    Cross Compilation
    -----------------
    When cross compiling, manually verify the data types defines in config.h
    as they cannot be accurately determined by configure. Most notably,
    AIDE_INO_TYPE will be set to "cross".

    Feedback and Support
    --------------------

    End user support is available on the AIDE mailing list:
