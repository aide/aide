.SH NAME
\fBaide\fP \- Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBaide\fP
\%[\fBparameters\fP]
\%\fBcommand\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBaide\fP is an intrusion detection system for checking the integrity
of files. 

.SH COMMANDS
.PP
.IP "--check, -C"
Checks the database for inconsistencies. You must have an initialized
database to do this. This is also the default command. Without any
command \fBaide\fP does a check.
.IP "--init, -i"
Initialize the database. You must initialize a database and move it to
the appropriate place before you can use the --check command.
.IP "--update, -u"
Checks the database and updates the database non-interactively. 
The input and output databases must be different.
.IP "--compare"
Compares two databases. They must be defined in configfile with
database=<url> and database_new=<url>.
.IP "--config-check, -D"
Stops after reading in the configuration file. Any errors will be reported.
If \fBaide\fP was compiled with the \(dq\fB--with-dbhmackey\fR\(dq option,
a hash for the config file will be calculated. See the aide manual for more
information.
.SH PARAMETERS
.IP "--config=\fBconfigfile\fR , -c \fBconfigfile\fR"
Configuration is read from file \fBconfigfile\fR instead of "./aide.conf". Use '-' for stdin.
.IP "--before=\(dq\fBconfigparameters\fR\(dq , -B \(dq\fBconfigparameters\fR\(dq"
These \fBconfigparameters\fR are handled before the reading of the
configuration file. See aide.conf (5) for more details on what to put
here. 
.IP "--after=\(dq\fBconfigparameters\fR\(dq , -A \(dq\fBconfigparameters\fR\(dq"
These \fBconfigparameters\fR are handled after the reading of the
configuration file. See aide.conf (5) for more details on what to put
here.
.IP --verbose=\fBverbosity_level\fR,-V\fBverbosity_level\fR
Controls how verbose \fBaide\fP is. Value must [0-255]. The default is
5. With no argument Value is set to 20. This parameter overrides the
value set in a configuration file.
.IP "--report=\fBreporter\fR,-r \fBreporter\fR"
\fBreporter\fR is a URL which tells \fBaide\fP where to send it's
output. See aide.conf (5) section URLS for available values.
.IP "--version,-v"
\fBaide\fP prints out its version number
.IP "--help,-h"
Prints out the standard help message.
