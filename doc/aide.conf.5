.TH AIDE.CONF 5 "2023-02-06" "aide v0.18" "AIDE"
.SH NAME
aide.conf - The configuration file for Advanced Intrusion Detection
Environment
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBaide.conf\fP is the configuration file for Advanced Intrusion
Detection Environment. \fBaide.conf\fP contains the runtime
configuration aide uses to initialize or check the AIDE database.
.PP
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
aide.conf is case-sensitive. Leading and trailing white spaces are
ignored. Each config lines must end with new line.
.PP
AIDE uses the backslash character (\fB\e\fR) as escape character for ' '
(space), '@' and '\e' (backslash) (e.g. '\e ' or '\e@'). To literally match a '\fB\e\fR'
in a file path with a regular expression you have to escape the backslash
twice (i.e. '\fB\e\e\e\e\fR').
.PP
There are three types of lines in \fBaide.conf\fP. First there are the
configuration options which are used to set configuration parameters and
define groups. Second, there are (restricted) rules that are used to indicate
which files are added to the database. Third, macro lines define or undefine
variables within the config file. Lines beginning with # are ignored as
comments.
.PP

.SH "CONFIG OPTIONS"
.PP
These lines have the format parameter=value. See URLS for a list of
valid urls.
.PP
.TP
database_in (type: URL, default: see \fB--version\fP output, added in AIDE v0.17)
.TQ
database (REMOVED in AIDE v0.19)
The url from which database is read. There can only be one of these
lines. If there are multiple database lines then the first is used.

.RS
.B Examples:

.RS 3
.nf
.B database_in=file:/var/lib/aide/aide.db
.fi

.RS 3

.RE

.RE

.RE

.IP "database_out (type: URL, default: see \fB--version\fP output)"
The url to which the new database is written to. There can only be one
of these lines. If there are multiple database_out lines then the
first is used.
.IP "database_new (type: URL, default: \fB<none>\fP)"
The url from which the other database for \-\-compare is read.
.IP "database_attrs (type: attribute expression, default: \fBH\fP, added in AIDE v0.16)"
The attributes of the (uncompressed) database files which are to be added to
the reports in report level >= \fBdatabase_attributes\fP . Only checksum attributes are
supported. To disable set
.I database_attrs
to
.RB ' E '.
.IP "database_add_metadata (type: bool, default: \fBtrue\fR, added in AIDE v0.16)"
Whether to add the AIDE version and the time of database generation as comments
to the database file or not. This option may be set to false by default in a
future release.

.IP "log_level (type: log level, default: \fBwarning\fR, added in AIDE v0.17)"
The log level to use. Log messages are written to \fIstderr\fR. If there are
multiple \fIlog_level\fR lines then the first one is used. The \-\-log-level or
\-L command line option overwrites this option.

.RS
The following log levels are available:

.RS
\fBerror\fP: show unrecoverable issues that have to be handled by the user. Errors are fatal to the AIDE process.

\fBwarning\fP: additionally show recoverable issues that most likely lead to unexpected behaviour and should be handled by the user

\fBnotice\fP: additionally show recoverable issues that sometimes lead to unexpected behaviour and might be handled by the user.

\fBinfo\fP: additionally show informational messages

\fBcompare\fP: additionally show messages to help to debug file comparison and (special) attribute handling

The log levels below are very verbose and can easily generate multiple gigabytes
of log data (depending on the number of processed files and the size of the
rule tree). For debugging it is recommended to use these log levels together with the
\fI--limit\fR parameter (see aide (1) for details).

\fBrule\fP: additionally show messages to help to debug the path rule matching

\fBconfig\fP: additionally show messages to help to debug config and rule parsing

\fBdebug\fP: additionally show messages that are useful to debug the application

\fBthread\fP: additionally show messages about thread processing (e.g. broadcast events)

\fBtrace\fP: additionallyt show messages about the internal data structures and the flow of the application (e.g. in-loop logging) (extremely verbose)

.RE

.RE

.IP "verbose (type: number, range: 0 - 255, default: \fB5\fR, REMOVED in AIDE v0.17)"
Removed, use \fBlog_level\fR and \fBreport_level\fR options instead.
.IP "gzip_dbout (type: bool, default: \fBfalse\fR)"
Whether the output to the database is gzipped or not. This option is available
only if zlib support is compiled in.
.IP "root_prefix (type: path, default: \fB<empty>\fR, added in AIDE v0.16)"
The prefix to strip from each file name in the file system before applying the
rules and writing to database. AIDE removes a trailing slash from the prefix.
If there are multiple root_prefix lines then the first one is used. This option
has no effect in compare mode.
.IP "acl_no_symlink_follow (type: bool, default: \fBfalse\fR)"
Whether to check ACLs for symlinks or not. This option
is available only if acl support is compiled in.
.IP "warn_dead_symlinks (type: path, default: \fBfalse\fR)"
Whether to warn about dead symlinks or not.
.IP "config_version (type: string, default: \fB<empty>\fR)"
The value of config_version is printed in the report and also printed
to the database. This is for informational purposes only. It has no
other functionality.
.IP "config_check_warn_unrestricted_rules (type: bool, default: \fBfalse\fR, added in AIDE v0.18)"
Whether to warn on unrestricted rules during config check. To explicitly
define unrestricted rules use \fB0\fR (zero) as restriction character.
.IP "num_workers (type: number|percentage, default: \fB1\fR, added in AIDE v0.18)"
Specifies the number of simultaneous workers (threads) for file attribute
processing (i.a. hashsum calculation).

The number of workers can be a positive integer (e.g. '4') or the percentage of
the available processors (e.g. '60%'). The resulting number of workers is
rounded up to the next integer (e.g. '60%' of 8 processors results in 5
workers).

If there are multiple \fInum_workers\fR lines then the first one is used.

Use 0 (zero) to disable (multi-threaded) workers.

The default value 1 (single worker thread) may be changed in a future release.

.TP
report_grouped (type: bool, default: \fBtrue\fR, added in AIDE v0.17)
.TQ
grouped (REMOVED in AIDE v0.19)
Group the files in the report by added, removed and changed files.
.TP
report_summarize_changes (type: bool, default: \fBtrue\fR, added in AIDE v0.17)
.TQ
summarize_changes (REMOVED in AIDE v0.19)
Summarize changes in the added, removed and changed files
sections of the report.

The general format is like the string YlZbpugamcinHAXSEC, where Y is
replaced by the file-type ('\fBf\fP' for a regular file, '\fBd\fP' for a
directory, '\fBl\fP' for a symbolic link, '\fBc\fP' for a character
device, '\fBb\fP' for a block device, '\fBp\fP' for a FIFO, '\fBs\fP' for
a unix socket, '\fBD\fP' for a Solaris door, '\fBP\fP' for a Solaris
event port, '\fB!\fP' if file type has changed and '\fB?\fP' otherwise).

The Z is replaced as follows: A '\fB=\fP' means that the size has not changed,
a '\fB<\fP' reports a shrinked size and a '\fB>\fP' reports a grown size.
The other letters in the string are the actual letters that will be output
if the associated attribute for the item has been changed or a '\fB.\fP' for no
change.

Otherwise a '\fB+\fP' is shown if the attribute has been added, a '\fB-\fP' if
it has been removed, a '\fB:\fP' if the attribute is ignored (but not forced)
or a ' ' if the attribute has not been checked.

The exceptions to this are: (1) a newly created file replaces each letter with
a '\fB+\fP', and (2) a removed file replaces each letter with a '\fB-\fP'.

The attribute that is associated with each letter is as follows:

.RS
.IP o
An \fBl\fP means that the link name has changed.
.IP o
A \fBb\fP means that the block count has changed.
.IP o

.SH "RULES"
.PP
AIDE supports three types of rules:
.TP
.B "Regular rule:"
<regex> <attribute expression>

Files and directories matching the regular expression
are added to the database.

.TP
.B "Negative rule:"
!<regex>

Files and directories matching the regular expression
are ignored and not added to the database.
The children of matching directories are also ignored.

.TP
.B "Equals rule:"
=<regex> <attribute expression>

Files and directories matching the regular expression
are added to the database.
The children of directories are only added
if the regular expression ends with a "/".
The children of sub-directories are not added at all.

.PP
Every regular expression has to start with an explicit "/".
An implicit ^ is added in front of each regular expression.
In other words,
the regular expressions are matched at the first position
against the complete path.
Special characters can be escaped using
two-digit URL encoding (for example, %20 to represent a space).

AIDE uses a deepest-match algorithm to find the tree node to search,
but a first-match algorithm inside the node.
(see also \fBrule\fP log level).

See EXAMPLES for examples.
.PP
More in-depth discussion of the selection algorithm can be found in
the AIDE manual.
.IP
.PP
.SH "RESTRICTED RULES"
.PP
Restricted rules are like normal rules but can be
restricted to file types (added in AIDE v0.16). The following file types are supported:

.TP
.B "\fBf\fP"
restrict rule to regular files
.TP
.B "\fBd\fP"
restrict rule to directories
.TP
.B "\fBl\fP"
restrict rule to symbolic links

.TP
.B "\fB0\fR"
empty restriction,
i.e. don't restrict rule (added in AIDE v0.18)
.PP
Multiple restrictions can be given
as a comma-separated list.
.PP
The syntax of restricted rules is as follows:
.TP
.B "Restricted regular rule"

.TP
.B "\fBI\fR"
ignore changed filename

When \fBI\fR is used, the inode of the old file is used to search for
a moved file in the new database.

Source and target file have to be located in the same directory and must share
the same attributes (except for special attributes
\fBANF\fR, \fBARF\fR, \fBI\fR, \fBgrowing\fR, and \fBcompressed\fR).

For moved entries a change of the \fBctime\fR attribute is ignored.

.TP
.B "\fBgrowing\fR"
ignore growing file (added in AIDE v0.18)

When \fBgrowing\fR is used, changes of the following attributes are
ignored:

\fBsize\fR: if new size is greater than old size

\fBbcount\fR: if new bcount is greater than old bcount

\fBatime\fR: if new atime is greater than old atime

\fBmtime\fR: if new mtime is greater than old mtime

\fBctime\fR: if new ctime is greater than old ctime

\fBhashsums\fR: if the hashsum of the new file restricted to the old size equals the hashsums of the old file

For hashsum attributes the \fBgrowing\fR attribute is ignored in compare mode.

.TP
.B "\fBcompressed\fR"
ignore compressed file (added in AIDE v0.18)

When \fBcompressed\fR is used, the uncompressed hashsums of the
new compressed file (supported compressions: \fBgzip\fR) are used to search for the
uncompressed file in the old database.

The old uncompressed and the new compressed file have to be located in the same
directory and must share the same attributes (except for special attributes
\fBANF\fR, \fBARF\fR, \fBI\fR, \fBgrowing\fR, and \fBcompressed\fR) including at least
one hashsum.

Changes of the \fBinode\fR, \fBsize\fR, \fBbcount\fR and \fBctime\fR attributes are ignored.

The \fBgrowing\fR attribute (i.e. the old file size) is not considered for

Log Handling
.PP
Logs pose a number of special challenges to AIDE.
An active log is nearly constantly being written to.
The process of log rotation changes file names for
files that are supposed to have unaltered contents.
To save space, Logs are compressed in the process of their rotation,
and finally, they get deleted.
AIDE is supposed to handle all those cases without generating reports,
and it is still expected to flag the cases when
an attacker tampers with logs.
.PP
The following examples suggest a way to handle the
common case of log rotation with the logrotate(8) program,
with its options \fBcompress\fR, \fBdelaycompress\fR and \fBnocopytruncate\fR set.
The vast majority of logs are rotated this way on most Linux systems.
.TP
.B "\fBActLog\fR=Full+growing+ANF+I"
.TQ
.B "/var/log/foo\e\e.log$ f ActLog"
An Active Log is typically named foo.log.
It is constanty being written to.
The file does neither change its mode nor its inode number.
The size only increases,
and what is written to the file is not supposed to change (growing).
During log rotation,
foo.log is typically renamed to foo.log.1 (or foo.log.0)
and the process is instructed to write to a new foo.log.
Log content is written to a new file (ANF)
and will eventually be renamed to foo.log.1 (I).
The growing attribute suppresses reports for files that
just had content appended when compared to the database.
A change of the old content is still reported!
.TP
.B "\fBRotLog\fR=Full"
.TQ
.B "/var/log/foo\e\e.log\e\e.1$ f RotLog"
foo.log.0 or foo.log.1 is called the Rotated Log,
the previously active log renamed to the
first name of the Log Series that is formed by the rotation mechanism.
Right after rotation, the file might still being written to by the daemon.
To aide, this looks like the Active Log's size decreases and its
inode and timestamps change.
The Rotated Log is not supposed to change its attributes
once the process has stopped writing to it.
Reports might be generated if aide runs while the process
still writes to the Rotated Log,
but this is quite unlikely to happen.
Some log rotation mechanisms rename
foo.log to foo.log.0 to foo.log.1.gz,
others rename foo.log to foo.log.1 to foo.2.log.gz.
.TP
.B "\fBCompSerLog\fR=Full+I+compressed"
.TQ
.B "/var/log/foo\e\e.log\e\e.2\e\e.gz$ f CompSerLog"
In the next rotation step,
foo.log.1 gets compressed to foo.log.2.gz,
becoming the Compressed Log in the Log Series.
With this rule,
AIDE does not report this step because it
uncompresses the contents of the file
and takes the checksum of the uncompressed content.
The contents strictly doesn't change,
but some attribute changes are ignored (compressed).
.TP
.B "\fBMidlSerLog\fR=Full+I"
.TQ
.B "/var/log/foo\e\e.log\e\e.[345]\e\e.gz$ f MidlSerLog"
In the next log rotation, all foo.log.{x} get renamed to foo.log.{x+1}.
The other attributes are not supposed to change.
.TP
.B "\fBLastSerLog\fR=Full+ARF"
.TQ
.B "/var/log/foo\e\e.log\e\e.6\e\e.gz$ f LastSerLog"
The configuration of the log rotation process specifies a number of log
generations to keep. The last log in the series is therefore removed
from the disk (ARF).
.PP
aide 0.18 does not yet support the following cases of log rotation:
.TP
.B "empty files"
It might be the case that a log is actually created, but never written to.
This commonly happens on rarely used web servers that use the log rotation
as a method to cater for data protection regulation.
In result, all files in a series are identical,
breaking the heuristics that aide uses to detect log rotation.
A possible workaround is to begin a newly rotated log with a timestamp.
With logrotate, this can be done in a postrotate scriptlet.
.TP
.B "nodelaycompress"
With logrotate's \fBnodelaycompress\fR option,
a log is immediately compressed after renaming it from the Active Log name.
For the time being, it is recommended to always use the \fBdelaycompress\fR option
to avoid this behavior.
.TP
.B "copytruncate"
With logrotate's \fBcopytruncate\fR option,
the Active Log is not renamed and newly created but
copied to the new file name.
After the copy operation, the old file is truncated to zero size,
allowing the daemon to continuously write to the already open file handle.
aide uses the Inode number to detect the rotation process.
That doesn't work with \fBcopytruncate\fR because the Inode stays
with the Active Log.
For the time being, it is recommended to avoid the \fBcopytruncate\fR option
to avoid this behavior.
