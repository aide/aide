.TH AIDE.CONF 5 "2021-02-10" "aide v0.17.3" "AIDE"
.SH NAME
aide.conf - The configuration file for Advanced Intrusion Detection
Environment
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBaide.conf\fP is the configuration file for Advanced Intrusion
Detection Environment. \fBaide.conf\fP contains the runtime
configuration aide uses to initialize or check the AIDE database.
.PP
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
aide.conf is case-sensitive. Leading and trailing white spaces are
ignored. Each config lines must end with new line.
.PP
AIDE uses the backslash character (\fB\e\fR) as escape character for ' '
(space), '@' and '\e' (backslash) (e.g. '\e ' or '\e@'). To literally match a '\fB\e\fR'
in a file path with a regular expression you have to escape the backslash
twice (i.e. '\fB\e\e\e\e\fR').
.PP
There are three types of lines in \fBaide.conf\fP. First there are the
configuration options which are used to set configuration parameters and
define groups. Second, there are (restricted) rules that are used to indicate
which files are added to the database. Third, macro lines define or undefine
variables within the config file. Lines beginning with # are ignored as
comments.
.PP

.SH "CONFIG OPTIONS"
.PP
These lines have the format parameter=value. See URLS for a list of
valid urls.
.PP
.TP
database_in (type: URL, default: see \fB--version\fP output, added in AIDE v0.17)
.TQ
database (DEPRECATED since AIDE v0.17, will be removed in AIDE v0.19)
The url from which database is read. There can only be one of these
lines. If there are multiple database lines then the first is used.

of these lines. If there are multiple database_out lines then the
first is used.
.IP "database_new (type: URL, default: \fB<none>\fP)"
The url from which the other database for \-\-compare is read.
.IP "database_attrs (type: attribute expression, default: \fBH\fP, added in AIDE v0.16)"
The attributes of the (uncompressed) database files which are to be added to
the reports in report level >= \fBdatabase_attributes\fP . Only checksum attributes are
supported. To disable set

to
.RB ' E '.
.IP "database_add_metadata (type: bool, default: \fBtrue\fR, added in AIDE v0.16)"
Whether to add the AIDE version and the time of database generation as comments
to the database file or not. This option may be set to false by default in a
future release.

.IP "log_level (type: log level, default: \fBwarning\fR, added in AIDE v0.17)"
The log level to use. Log messages are written to \fIstderr\fR. If there are
multiple \fIlog_level\fR lines then the first one is used. The \-\-log-level or
\-L command line option overwrites this option.

.RS
The following log levels are available:

.RS
\fBerror\fP: show unrecoverable issues that have to be handled by the user. Errors are fatal to the AIDE process.

\fBwarning\fP: additionally show recoverable issues that most likely lead to unexpected behaviour and should be handled by the user

\fBnotice\fP: additionally show recoverable issues that sometimes lead to unexpected behaviour and might be handled by the user.

.RE

.RE

.IP "verbose (type: number, range: 0 - 255, default: \fB5\fR, REMOVED in AIDE v0.17)"
Remvoed, use \fBlog_level\fR and \fBreport_level\fR options instead
.IP "gzip_dbout (type: bool, default: \fBfalse\fR)"
Whether the output to the database is gzipped or not. This option is available
only if zlib support is compiled in.
.IP "root_prefix (type: path, default: \fB<empty>\fR, added in AIDE v0.16)"
The prefix to strip from each file name in the file system before applying the
rules and writing to database. AIDE removes a trailing slash from the prefix.
If there are multiple root_prefix lines then the first one is used. This option
has no effect in compare mode.
.IP "acl_no_symlink_follow (type: bool, default: \fBfalse\fR)"
Whether to check ACLs for symlinks or not. This option
is available only if acl support is compiled in.
.IP "warn_dead_symlinks (type: path, default: \fBfalse\fR)"
Whether to warn about dead symlinks or not.
.IP "config_version (type: string, default: \fB<empty>\fR)"
The value of config_version is printed in the report and also printed
to the database. This is for informational purposes only. It has no
other functionality.
.IP "config_check_warn_unrestricted_rules (type: bool, default: \fBfalse\fR, added in AIDE v0.18)"
Whether to warn on unrestricted rules during config check. To explicitly
define unrestricted rules use \fB0\fR (zero) as restriction character.
.IP "num_workers (type: number|percentage, default: \fB1\fR, added in AIDE v0.18)"
Specifies the number of simultaneous workers (threads) for file attribute
processing (i.a. hashsum calculation).

The number of workers can be a positive integer (e.g. '4') or the percentage of
the available processors (e.g. '60%'). The resulting number of workers is
rounded up to the next integer (e.g. '60%' of 8 processors results in 5
workers).

If there are multiple \fInum_workers\fR lines then the first one is used.  Use
0 (zero) to disable multi-threading and use the "old" parent-child/mmap implementation.

The default value 1 (single worker thread) may be changed in a future release.

Please note that the file content is read via \fIread\fR system call instead of
\fImmap\fR when threads are used.

.IP "Group definitions"
If the parameter is not one of the previous parameters then it is
regarded as a group definition. Value is then regarded as an
attribute expression.
.IP
See DEFAULT GROUPS for an explanation of default predefined groups.

Group names are limited to alphanumeric characters (\fBA-Za-z0-9\fP).

.TP
report_grouped (type: bool, default: \fBtrue\fR, added in AIDE v0.17)
.TQ
grouped (DEPRECATED since AIDE v0.17, will be removed in AIDE v0.19)
Group the files in the report by added, removed and changed files.
.TP
report_summarize_changes (type: bool, default: \fBtrue\fR, added in AIDE v0.17)
.TQ
summarize_changes (DEPRECATED since AIDE v0.17, will be removed in AIDE v0.19)
Summarize changes in the added, removed and changed files
sections of the report.

The general format is like the string YlZbpugamcinHAXSEC, where Y is
replaced by the file-type ('\fBf\fP' for a regular file, '\fBd\fP' for a
directory, '\fBl\fP' for a symbolic link, '\fBc\fP' for a character
device, '\fBb\fP' for a block device, '\fBp\fP' for a FIFO, '\fBs\fP' for
a unix socket, '\fBD\fP' for a Solaris door, '\fBP\fP' for a Solaris
event port, '\fB!\fP' if file type has changed and '\fB?\fP' otherwise).

The Z is replaced as follows: A '\fB=\fP' means that the size has not changed,
a '\fB<\fP' reports a shrinked size and a '\fB>\fP' reports a grown size.
The other letters in the string are the actual letters that will be output
if the associated attribute for the item has been changed or a '\fB.\fP' for no
change.

Otherwise a '\fB+\fP' is shown if the attribute has been added, a '\fB-\fP' if
it has been removed, a '\fB:\fP' if the attribute is ignored (but not forced)
or a ' ' if the attribute has not been checked.

The exceptions to this are: (1) a newly created file replaces each letter with
a '\fB+\fP', and (2) a removed file replaces each letter with a '\fB-\fP'.

The attribute that is associated with each letter is as follows:

.RS
.IP o
A \fBl\fP means that the link name has changed.
.IP o
A \fBb\fP means that the block count has changed.
.IP o

for the available attributes. Use \fB0\fR (zero) to not ignore any
attribute. Ignored attributes are represented by a ':' in the report.

By default AIDE also reports changes of the read-only attributes mentioned in
.BR chattr (1)
(see example below how to ignore those changes).

.SH "RULES"
.PP
AIDE supports three types of rules:

Regular rule:
.RS 3

.nf
.B <regex> <attribute expression>
.fi

Files and directories matching the regular expression are added to the
database.

.RE

Negative rule:
.RS 3

.nf
.B !<regex>
.fi

Files and directories matching the regular expression are ignored and not added
to the database. The children of matching directories are also ignored.

.RE

Equals rule:
.RS 3

.nf
.B =<regex> <attribute expression>
.fi

Files and directories matching the regular expression are added to the
database. The children of directories are only added if the regular expression
ends with a "/". The children of sub-directories are not added at all.

.RE

Every regular expression has to start with a "/". An implicit ^ is added in
front of each regular expression. In other words the regular expressions are
matched at the first position against the complete filename (i.e. including the
path). Special characters in your filenames can be escaped using two-digit URL
encoding (for example, %20 to represent a space).

AIDE uses a deepest-match algorithm to find the tree node to search, but a
first-match algorithm inside the node. (see also  \fB rule \fP log level).

See EXAMPLES for examples.
.PP
More in-depth discussion of the selection algorithm can be found in
the AIDE manual.
.IP
.PP
.SH "RESTRICTED RULES"
.PP
Restricted rules are like normal rules but can be
restricted to file types (added in AIDE v0.16). The following file types are supported:

.RS

\fBf\fP: restrict rule to regular files

\fBd\fP: restrict rule to directories

\fBl\fP: restrict rule to symbolic links

\fBc\fP: restrict rule to character devices

\fBb\fP: restrict rule to block devices

\fBp\fP: restrict rule to FIFO files

\fBs\fP: restrict rule to UNIX sockets

\fBD\fP: restrict rule to Solaris doors

\fBP\fP: restrict rule to Solaris event ports

\fB0\fR: empty restriction, i.e. don't restrict rule (added in AIDE v0.18)
.RE

The file types are separated by comma. The syntax of restricted
rules is as follows:

Restricted regular rule:

Deprecated, use \fBgrowing+s\fR attributes instead

.IP "\fBI\fR:	ignore changed filename"

When \fBI\fR is used, the inode of the old file is used to search for
a moved file in the new database.

Source and target file have to be located in the same directory and must share
the same attributes (except for special attributes
\fBANF\fR+\fBARF\fR+\fBI\fR+\fBgrowing\fR+\fBcompressed\fR).

For moved entries a change of the \fBctime\fR attribute is ignored.

.IP "\fBgrowing\fR:	ignore growing file (added in AIDE v0.18)"

When \fBgrowing\fR is used, changes of the following attributes are
ignored:

\fBsize\fR: if new size is greater than old size

\fBbcount\fR: if new bcount is greater than old bcount

\fBatime\fR: if new atime is greater than old atime

\fBmtime\fR: if new mtime is greater than old mtime

\fBctime\fR: if new ctime is greater than old ctime

\fBhashsums\fR: if the hashsum of the new file restricted to the old size equals the hashsums of the old file

For hashsum attributes the \fBgrowing\fR attribute is ignored in compare mode.

.IP "\fBcompressed\fR:	ignore compressed file (added in AIDE v0.18)"

When \fBcompressed\fR is used, the uncompressed hashsums of the
new compressed file (supported compressions: \fBgzip\fR) are used to search for the
uncompressed file in the old database.

The old uncompressed and the new compressed file have to be located in the same
directory and must share the same attributes (except for special attributes
\fBANF\fR+\fBARF\fR+\fBI\fR+\fBgrowing\fR+\fBcompressed\fR) including at least
one hashsum.

Changes of the \fBinode\fR, \fBsize\fR, \fBbcount\fR and \fBctime\fR attributes are ignored.

The \fBgrowing\fR attribute (i.e. the old file size) is not considered for
compressed files during the calculation of the uncompressed hashsums.

The \fBcompressed\fR attribute is ignored in compare mode.

.IP "\fBANF\fR:	allow new files
When 'ANF' is used, new files are added to the new database, but are

.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
.B "/ R"
.LP
This adds all files on your machine to the database. This one line
is a fully qualified configuration file.
.IP
.B "!/dev$"
.LP
This ignores the /dev directory structure.
.IP
.B "=/foo R"
.LP
Only /foo and /foobar are taken into the database. None of their children are
added.
.IP
.B "=/foo/ R"
.LP
Only /foo and its children (e.g. /foo/file and /foo/directory) are taken into
the database. The children of sub-directories (e.g. /foo/directory/bar) are not
added.
.IP
.B "\fBAll\fR=ftype+p+l+u+g+s+m+c+a+i+b+n+H+X"
.LP
This line defines group \fBAll\fR. It has all attributes, all compiled in
hashsums (\fBH\fR) and all compiled in extra file attributes (\fBX\fR).
See '--version' output for the compiled in hashsums and extra groups.
