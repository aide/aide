.TH AIDE.CONF 5 "May 19, 2019" "aide v0.16.2" "AIDE"
.SH NAME
aide.conf - The configuration file for Advanced Intrusion Detection
Environment
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBaide.conf\fP is the configuration file for Advanced Intrusion
Detection Environment. \fBaide.conf\fP contains the runtime
configuration aide uses to initialize or check the AIDE database.
.PP
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
\fBaide.conf\fP is similar in to Tripwire(tm)'s configuration
file. With little effort tw.conf can be converted to aide.conf.
.PP
aide.conf is case-sensitive. Leading and trailing white spaces are
ignored.
.PP
There are three types of lines in \fBaide.conf\fP. First there are the
configuration lines which are used to set configuration parameters and
define/undefine variables. Second, there are (restricted) selection lines that
are used to indicate which files are added to the database. Third, macro lines
define or undefine variables within the config file. Lines beginning with #
are ignored as comments.
.PP
.SH "CONFIG LINES"
.PP
These lines have the format parameter=value. See URLS for a list of
valid urls.
.PP
.IP "database"
The url from which database is read. There can only be one of these
lines. If there are multiple database lines then the first is used.
The default value is "@prefix@/etc/aide.db".
.IP "database_out"
The url to which the new database is written to. There can only be one
of these lines. If there are multiple database_out lines then the
first is used. The default value is "@prefix@/etc/aide.db.new".
.IP "database_new"
The url from which the other database for \-\-compare is read.
There is no default for this one.
.IP "database_attrs"
The attributes of the (uncompressed) database files which are to be added to
the reports in report level >= \fBdatabase_attributes\fP . Only checksum attributes are
supported. To disable set
.I database_attrs
to
.RB ' E '.
By default all compiled in checksums are added to the report.
.IP "database_add_metadata"
Whether to add the AIDE version and the time of database generation as comments
to the database file or not. Valid values are yes, true, no and false. The
default is to add the AIDE version and the time of database generation. This
option may be set to no by default in a future release.
.IP "verbose"
The level of messages that is output. This value can be 0-255
inclusive. This parameter can only be given once. Value from the first
occurrence is used. If \-\-verbose or \-V is used then the value from that
is used. The default is 5. If verbosity is 20 then additional output is written
when doing \-\-check, \-\-update or \-\-compare. Verbose messages go to stderr.
.IP "gzip_dbout"
Whether the output to the database is gzipped or not. Valid values are
yes,true,no and false. The default is no. This option is available only
if zlib support is compiled in.
.IP "root_prefix"
The prefix to strip from each file name in the file system before applying the
rules and writing to database. AIDE removes a trailing slash from the prefix.
The default is no (an empty) prefix. This option has no effect in
compare mode.
.IP "acl_no_symlink_follow"
Whether to check ACLs for symlinks or not. Valid values are
yes,true,no and false. The default is to follow symlinks. This option
is available only if acl support is compiled in.
.IP "warn_dead_symlinks"
Whether to warn about dead symlinks or not. Valid values are
yes,true,no and false. The default is not to warn about dead symlinks.
.IP "config_version"
The value of config_version is printed in the report and also printed
to the database. This is for informational purposes only. It has no
other functionality.
.IP "Group definitions"
If the parameter is not one of the previous parameters then it is
regarded as a group definition. Value is then regarded as an
expression. Expression is of the following form.
.IP
.nf
    <predefined group>| <expr> + <predefined group>
                      | <expr> - <predefined group>
.fi
.IP
See DEFAULT GROUPS for an explanation of default predefined groups.
Note that this is different from the way Tripwire(tm) does it.
.PP

.SH REPORT CONFIG LINES
.PP

.IP "report_url (type: URL, default: \fBstdout\fR)"

The URL that the output is written to.

Multiple instances of the \fBreport_url\fR option are supported.

.RS

.PP
The following report options are available (to take effect they
have to be set before \fBreport_url\fR):
.PP

.IP "report_level (type: enum, default: \fBchanged_attributes\fR)"

The report level to use. The available report levels are as follows:

.RS
\fBminimal\fP: print single line whether AIDE found differences to the database

\fBsummary\fP: additionally print number of added, removed and changed files

\fBdatabase_attributes\fP: additionally print database checksums

\fBlist_entries\fP: additionally print lists of added, removed and changed entries

\fBchanged_attributes\fP: additionally print details about changed entries

\fBadded_removed_attributes\fP: additionally print details about added and removed attributes

\fBadded_removed_entries\fP: additionally print details about added and removed entries
.RE
.IP "report_base16 (type: bool, default: \fBfalse\fR)"
Base16 encode the checksums in the report. The default is to
report checksums in base64 encoding.
.IP "report_detailed_init (type: bool, default: \fBfalse\fR)"
Report added files (report level >= \fBlist_entries\fP) and their details (report
level >= \fBadded_removed_entries\fP) in initialization mode.
.IP "report_quiet (type: bool, default: \fBfalse\fR)"
Suppress report output if no differences to the database have been found
.TP
report_grouped (type: bool, default: \fBtrue\fR)
.TQ
grouped (DEPRECATED, will be removed in a future release)
Group the files in the report by added, removed and changed files.
.TP
report_summarize_changes (type: bool, default: \fBtrue\fR)
.TQ
summarize_changes (DEPRECATED, will be removed in a future release)
Summarize changes in the added, removed and changed files
sections of the report.

The general format is like the string YlZbpugamcinDAXSEC, where Y is
replaced by the file-type (\fBf\fP for a regular file, \fBd\fP for a
directory, \fBl\fP for a symbolic link, \fBc\fP for a character device,
\fBb\fP for a block device, \fBp\fP for a FIFO, \fBs\fP for a unix
socket, \fBD\fP for a Solaris door, \fBP\fP for a Solaris event port, \fB!\fP
if file type has changed and \fB?\fP otherwise).

The Z is replaced as follows: A \fB=\fP means that the size has not changed,
a \fB<\fP reports a shrinked size and a \fB>\fP reports a grown size.

The other letters in the string are the actual letters that will be output
if the associated attribute for the item has been changed or a "." for no
change, a "+" if the attribute has been added, a "-" if it has been removed,
a ":" if the attribute is ignored (but not forced) or a " " if the attribute has
not been checked. The exceptions to this are: (1) a newly created file replaces
each letter with a "+", and (2) a removed file replaces each letter with a "-".

The attribute that is associated with each letter is as follows:

.RS
.IP o
A \fBl\fP means that the link name has changed.
.IP o
A \fBb\fP means that the block count has changed.

attribute is not considered for file change but printed in the final report as long as the file has been otherwise changed.
.IP "report_ignore_e2fsattrs (type: string, default: \fB0\fR)"
List (no delimiter) of ext2 file attributes which are to be ignored in the report.
See
.BR chattr (1)
for the available attributes. Use \fB0\fR (zero) to not ignore any
attribute. Ignored attributes are represented by a ':' in the output.

.RS
.B Example:

.RS 3
Ignore changes of the ext2 file attributes compression error (E), huge file
(h), indexed directory (I):

.SH "SELECTION LINES"
.PP
AIDE supports three types of selection lines:

Regular selection line:
.RS 3

.nf
.B <regex> <group>
.fi

Files and directories matching the regular expression are added to the
database.

.RE

Negative selection line:
.RS 3

.nf
.B !<regex>
.fi

Files and directories matching the regular expression are ignored and not added
to the database.

.RE

Equals selection line:
.RS 3

.nf
.B =<regex> <group>
.fi

Files and directories matching the regular expression are added to the
database. The children of directories are only added if the regular expression
ends with a "/". The children of sub-directories are not added at all.

.RE

Every regular expression has to start with a "/". An implicit ^ is added in
front of each regular expression. In other words the regular expressions are
matched at the first position against the complete filename (i.e. including the
path). Special characters in your filenames can be escaped using two-digit URL
encoding (for example, %20 to represent a space).

See EXAMPLES and doc/aide.conf for examples.
.PP
More in-depth discussion of the selection algorithm can be found in
the AIDE manual.
.IP
.PP
.SH "RESTRICTED SELECTION LINES"
.PP
Restricted selection lines are like normal selection lines but can be
restricted to file types. The following file types are supported:

.RS

\fBf\fP: restrict rule to regular files

\fBd\fP: restrict rule to directories

\fBl\fP: restrict rule to symbolic links

\fBc\fP: restrict rule to character devices

\fBb\fP: restrict rule to block devices

\fBp\fP: restrict rule to FIFO files

\fBs\fP: restrict rule to UNIX sockets

\fBD\fP: restrict rule to Solaris doors

\fBP\fP: restrict rule to Solaris event ports
.RE

The file types are separated by comma. The syntax of restricted
selection lines is as follows:

Restricted regular selection line:
.RS 3
.nf
.B <regex> <file types> <group>
.fi
.RE

Restricted negative selection line:
.RS 3
.nf
.B !<regex> <file types>
.fi
.RE

Restricted equals selection line:
.RS 3
.nf
.B =<regex> <file types> <group>
.fi
.RE

.B Examples
.RS 3
Only add directories and files to the database:

.RS 3
.nf
.B / d,f R
.fi
.RE

.PP
.SH "MACRO LINES"
.PP
.IP "@@define \fBVAR\fR \fBval\fR"
Define variable \fBVAR\fR to value \fBval\fR.
.IP "@@undef \fBVAR\fR"
Undefine variable \fBVAR\fR.
.IP "@@ifdef \fBVAR\fR, @@ifndef \fBVAR\fR"
@@ifdef begins an if statement. It must be terminated with an @@endif
statement. The lines between @@ifdef and @@endif are used if variable
\fBVAR\fR is defined. If there is an @@else statement then the part
between @@ifdef and @@else is used is \fBVAR\fR is defined otherwise
the part between @@else and @@endif is used. @@ifndef reverses the
logic of @@ifdef statement but otherwise works similarly.
.IP "@@ifhost \fBhostname\fR, @@ifnhost \fBhostname\fR"
@@ifhost works like @@ifdef only difference is that it checks whether
\fBhostname\fR equals the name of the host that AIDE is running on.
\fBhostname\fR is the name of the host without the domainname
(hostname, not hostname.example.com).
.IP "@@{\fBVAR\fR}"
@@{\fBVAR\fR} is replaced with the value of the variable \fBVAR\fR.
If variable \fBVAR\fR is not defined an empty string is used. Unlike
Tripwire(tm) @@VAR is NOT supported. One special \fBVAR\fR is @@{HOSTNAME}
which is substituted for the hostname of the current system.
.IP "@@else"
Begins the else part of an if statement.
.IP "@@endif"
Ends an if statement.
.IP "@@include \fBVAR\fR"
Includes the file \fBVAR\fR. The content of the file is used as if it
were inserted in this part of the config file.
.PP
.SH URLS
Urls can be one of the following. Input urls cannot be used as outputs
and vice versa.
.IP "stdout"
.IP "stderr"
Output is sent to stdout,stderr respectively.
.IP "stdin"
Input is read from stdin.
.IP "file://\fBfilename\fR"
Input is read from \fBfilename\fR or output is written to
\fBfilename\fR.
.IP "fd:\fBnumber\fR"
Input is read from filedescriptor \fBnumber\fR or output is written to
\fBnumber\fR.

.LP
Please note that 'I' and 'c' are incompatible. When the name of a file
is changed, its ctime is updated as well. When you put 'c' and 'I' in
the same rule the, a changed ctime is silently ignored.
.LP
When 'ANF' is used, new files are added to the new database, but are
ignored in the report.
.LP
When 'ARF' is used, files missing on disk are omitted from the new database,
but are ignored in the report.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
.B "/ R"
.LP
This adds all files on your machine to the database. This one line
is a fully qualified configuration file.
.IP
.B "!/dev"
.LP
This ignores the /dev directory structure.
.IP
.B "=/foo R"
.LP
Only /foo and /foobar are taken into the database. None of their children are
added.
.IP
.B "=/foo/ R"
.LP
Only /foo and its children (e.g. /foo/file and /foo/directory) are taken into
the database. The children of sub-directories (e.g. /foo/directory/bar) are not
added.
.IP
.B "\fBAll\fR=p+i+n+u+g+s+m+c+a+md5+sha1+tiger+rmd160"
.LP
This line defines group \fBAll\fR. It has all attributes and all
md checksum functions. If you absolutely want all digest functions
then you should enable mhash support and add
+crc32+haval+gost to the end of the definition for
\fBAll\fR. Mhash support can only be enabled at compile-time.
